# aTunes => Smart Music Player
aTunes is a smart music player application developed for Android, designed to offer an innovative and feature-rich alternative to traditional music players. The project was conceived and developed as part of a hackathon competition at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, organized by the college's robotics forum, [TRF](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-robotics-forum/).
# Development History
This project was initiated by me and my friend [Ansh Gaikwad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anshgaikwad/) to participate in a local hackathon at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology. Despite being first-year students, our team reached the final round, competing against senior students. Although we did not win, the project was recognized for its innovative approach and multiple unique features, ultimately securing the runner-up position.

During the competition, the judges changed the rules and decided that only one group would be awarded the first position immediately, with the remaining teams participating in a second round of competition open to all. However, this second round was never held due to the Quarantine of 2019. Although aTunes did not secure the top position, the project showcased significant potential and provided valuable experience to us for future developments and projects.

# Install
Run the command in your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/AnshGaikwad/aTunes-SmartMusicPlayer.git
```
Or you can just clone it through [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) which will be much easier.
Note: Always run the application on a real device rather running it on a emulator

# Online Firebase Database
We can upload songs and see uploaded songs which other users have uploaded under the `Go Online` section. By this means we can share songs with our friends and get relief from low storage issues.
# Voice Controlled Features
There are two types of modes in this app `theLazyMode` and `theNonLazyMode`. The Voice Controlled Features are available when the lazyMode is turned on. They can be used by keeping your finger on the screen and then releasing the finger when the command has been finished speaking.

> 2. PLAY => play, resume, start

# Some of the unsolved bugs
> 1. The playlist section has not been programmed yet and is under progress.
> 2. The current song must be paused, before playing the next song or both the songs will be turned on at the same time. I will really appreciate if anyone is able to help me fix this bug.
