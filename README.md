# aTunes => Smart Music Player
I wanted to win a competition in my college and I wasn't getting any ideas. So, I asked my friend [Arshad Patel](https://github.com/arshadpatel2001) about any ideas and he suggested to make a simple music player and then add some features which no one has thought about it. So we started developing a Smart Music Player and named it aTunes as it is an android app (such as iTunes in iphone as a IOS app).
# History
I started this project with my friend [Arshad Patel](https://github.com/arshadpatel2001) to compete in a local hackathon in my college [Vishwarkma Institue of Technology](http://www.vit.edu/) organised by our college's robotics team, [TRF](https://vitpunerobotics.com/) in the event 'robodroid'. It was an android app development competition and the top three groups were to be given 2 [rasberry pi's](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) for a group, for each member, i.e. 6 [rasberry pi's](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). We were among the top 4 selected in the final round of which the rest of the three groups were students of 2nd and 3rd yr and we were the only ones from the 1st yr and then the battle for the top 3 positions was started. When the presentations were finished, we realised that we will be among the one's who will be taking a [rasberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) home but unfortunately the judge of the contest changed the rules and decided to give only one group the [rasberry pi's](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)s at that moment and the rest 2 will be given in a competition which will be open for all again and that will be planned later. Still, we had a feeling that we can secure the first place as the idea of the app was innovative and it had multiple features than any other ordinary music player. But we couldn't, the winner app competition was the debate app made by some seniors and it feels frustrating to say but there app was great with no bugs and they had invested a lot of efforts in it. Later, we didnt waste any time and planned to strike with everything we have got in the next hackathon but it was never held due to the Quarantine of 2019. 
# Install
Run the command in your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/AnshGaikwad/aTunes-SmartMusicPlayer.git
```
Or you can just clone it through [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) which will be much easier.
# Features
> 1. Swipe Gesture Controls
> 2. Online Firebase Database

# Swipe Gesture Controls
> 1. UP => VOLUME

# Online Firebase Database
We can upload songs and see uploaded songs which other users have uploaded under the `Go Online` section. By this means we can share songs with our friends and get relief from low storage issues.
# Voice Controlled Features
There are two types of modes in this app theLazyMode and theNonLazyMode. The Voice Controlled Features are available when the lazyMode is turned on. They can be used by keeping your finger on the screen and then releasing the finger when the command has been finished speaking.
> 1. PAUSE => pause, stop
> 2. PLAY => play, resume, start
> 3. NEXT => next, next song
> 4. PREVIOUS => previous, last
> 5. BACK => back
> 6. MUTE => mute, volume off
> 7. VOLUME => volume, volume on 
# Some of the unsolved bugs
> 1. The playlist section has not been programmed yet and is under progress.
> 2. The current song must be paused, before playing the next song or both the songs will be turned on at the same time. I will love if anyone is able to help me fix this bug.
