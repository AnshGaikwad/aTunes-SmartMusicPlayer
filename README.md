# aTunes => Smart Music Player
I wanted to win a hackathon in my college and I wasn't getting any ideas. So, I asked my friend [Arshad Patel](https://github.com/arshadpatel2001) about any ideas and he suggested to make a simple music player and then add some features which no one has thought about it. So we started developing a Smart Music Player and named it aTunes as it is an [android](https://www.android.com/intl/en_in/) app (such as [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/in/itunes/) in [iphone](https://www.apple.com/in/iphone/) as an [IOS](https://www.apple.com/in/ios/ios-13/) app).
# Install
Run the command in your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/AnshGaikwad/aTunes-SmartMusicPlayer.git
```
Or you can just clone it through [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) which will be much easier.
Note: Always run te application on a real device rather running it on a emulator
# Features
> 1. Swipe Gesture Controls
> 2. Online Firebase Database
> 3. Voice Controlled Features
> 4. Cool Black-Grey-White GUI
# Swipe Gesture Controls
> 1. UP => VOLUME  
> 2. DOWN => MUTE  
> 3. LEFT => PREVIOUS SONG  
> 4. RIGHT => NEXT SONG  
# Online Firebase Database
We can upload songs and see uploaded songs which other users have uploaded under the `Go Online` section. By this means we can share songs with our friends and get relief from low storage issues.
# Voice Controlled Features
There are two types of modes in this app `theLazyMode` and `theNonLazyMode`. The Voice Controlled Features are available when the lazyMode is turned on. They can be used by keeping your finger on the screen and then releasing the finger when the command has been finished speaking.
> 1. PAUSE => pause, stop
> 2. PLAY => play, resume, start
> 3. NEXT => next, next song
> 4. PREVIOUS => previous, last
> 5. BACK => back
> 6. MUTE => mute, volume off
> 7. VOLUME => volume, volume on 
# Some of the unsolved bugs
> 1. The playlist section has not been programmed yet and is under progress.
> 2. The current song must be paused, before playing the next song or both the songs will be turned on at the same time. I will really appreciate if anyone is able to help me fix this bug.
